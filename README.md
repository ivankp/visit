# Goal

The library implements type-based pattern matching for visiting objects
contained in type-erased wrappers such as `std::any`.

# Usage

Copy two header files,
[callable.hpp](include/callable.hpp) and [visit.hpp](include/visit.hpp)
into your project.

[callable.hpp](include/callable.hpp) can be used independently.
